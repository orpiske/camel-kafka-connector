When using camel-robotframework-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-robotframework-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

The camel-robotframework sink connector supports 102 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.resourceUri* | Path to the resource. You can prefix with: classpath, file, http, ref, or bean. classpath, file and http loads the resource using these protocols (classpath is default). ref will lookup the resource in the registry. bean will call a method on a bean to be used as the resource. For bean you can specify the method name after dot, eg bean:myBean.myMethod. | null | HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowContextMapAll* | Sets whether the context map should allow access to all details. By default only the message body and headers can be accessed. This option can be enabled for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext. Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowTemplateFromHeader* | Whether to allow to use resource template from header or not (default false). Enabling this allows to specify dynamic templates via message header. However this can be seen as a potential security vulnerability if the header is coming from a malicious user, so use this with care. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.argumentFile* | A text file to read more arguments from. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.combinedTagStats* | Creates combined statistics based on tags. Use the format tags:title List | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.monitorColors* | Using ANSI colors in console. Normally colors work in unixes but not in Windows. Default is 'on'. 'on' - use colors in unixes but not in Windows 'off' - never use colors 'force' - always use colors (also in Windows) | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.monitorWidth* | Width of the monitor output. Default is 78. | "78" | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.name* | Sets the name of the top-level tests suites. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.nonCriticalTags* | Tests that have the given tags are not critical. List | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.noStatusReturnCode* | If true, sets the return code to zero regardless of failures in test cases. Error codes are returned normally. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.output* | Sets the path to the generated output file. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.outputDirectory* | Configures where generated reports are to be placed. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.randomize* | Sets the test execution order to be randomized. Valid values are all, suite, and test | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.report* | Sets the path to the generated report file. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reportBackground* | Sets background colors for the generated report and summary. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reportTitle* | Sets a title for the generated tests report. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.runEmptySuite* | Executes tests also if the top level test suite is empty. Useful e.g. with --include/--exclude when it is not an error that no test matches the condition. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.runFailed* | Re-run failed tests, based on output.xml file. | null | MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.runMode* | Sets the execution mode for this tests run. Note that this setting has been deprecated in Robot Framework 2.8. Use separate dryryn, skipTeardownOnExit, exitOnFailure, and randomize settings instead. | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.splitOutputs* | Splits output and log files. | null | MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | MEDIUM

This option can be enabled for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext. Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API. | false | MEDIUM
| *camel.component.robotframework.allowTemplateFrom Header* | Whether to allow to use resource template from header or not (default false). Enabling this allows to specify dynamic templates via message header.
