# For the index operation, it might be necessary to provide or implement
# a transformer. A sample configuration would be similar to the commented
# code below:
# transforms=ElasticSearchTransformer

# This is the sample Transformer used in the integration test code that transforms
# Kafka's ConnectRecord to a Map.
# transforms.ElasticSearchTransformer.type=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.elasticsearch.sink.transforms.ConnectRecordValueToMapTransformer

# This is a configuration for the sample transformer that defines the
# key used in the map.
